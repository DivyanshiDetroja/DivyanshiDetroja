Everyday I'm trying to build a life I love, and apps that (hopefully) everyone else does. I enjoy participating in hackathons and different kinds of engineering workshops be it 3d printing, photoshop, robotics, woodworks etc. I am currently a full time master's in computer science student at George Mason University, VA. I am delving into open-source and machine learning as of now. I would love to collaborate on projects or upcoming hackathons, hit me up :D
